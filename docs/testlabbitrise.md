Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the “unit”) meets its design and behaves as intended.

In this tutorial, you will learn how about unit testing, its benefits, its types, unit testing tools, how to write a simple unit test in Android studio, and automating the testing processing using Bitrise.

## What is Unit Testing?
Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

## Types of Unit Testing
In software engineering we have two types of unit testing which are:
- Manual
- Automated

## Benefits of Unit Testing?
- Unit testing will help the developer to fix/catch bugs early in the software development.
- It helps the developers to understand the codebase.
- unit-testing your project will help the developer structure the codebase and use an architecture
- you can test individual part of your code
- it saves time and cost in testing because you are using the JVM to run your test

## Unit Testing Tools
There are lots of free tools that will assist a developer to test his code, below are a few of them:

**Junit:** Unit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit. learn more here

**Robolectric:** Robolectric lets you run your tests on your workstation, or on your continuous integration environment in a regular JVM, without an emulator. learn more here

**Mockito:** Mockito is a mocking framework that tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with a clean & simple API. learn more here

**Truth:** Truth is a fluent and flexible open-source testing framework designed to make test assertions and failure messages more readable. learn more here

**Hamcrest:** Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing ‘match’ rules to be defined declaratively. learn more here
