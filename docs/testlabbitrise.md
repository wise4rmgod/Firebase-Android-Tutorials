Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the “unit”) meets its design and behaves as intended.

In this tutorial, you will learn how about unit testing, its benefits, its types, unit testing tools, how to write a simple unit test in Android studio, and automating the testing processing using Bitrise.

## What is Unit Testing?
Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.
