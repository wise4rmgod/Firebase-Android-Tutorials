You use the Performance Monitoring SDK to collect performance data from your app, then review and analyze that data in the Firebase console. Performance Monitoring helps you to understand where and when the performance of your app can be improved so that you can use that information to fix performance issues.
It is very important to have it in your app especially if you want your app to grow in the right direction, below are the benefits of it.
